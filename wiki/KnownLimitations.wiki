#summary things that are known to not work

= Known Limitations =

Unfortunately there are several things that are either not supported or not very well supported.
 * all methods on the jQuery object that don't require a constructor (like .ajax()) are not supported
 * Deferreds are not supported
 * Function "overloading" is not supported. Some functions like .html() are "overloading" where the function behaves differently on the number of arguments. Either as a setter or a getter. In such cases only one version of the function is shown.
 * Optional arguments are not very well supported.
